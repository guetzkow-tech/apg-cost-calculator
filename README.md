# APG Cost of Living Calculator

This repository contains a **minimal, framework-free prototype** of the All Points Guide (APG) Cost of Living Calculator.

The purpose of this project is to:
- Prove the calculator logic works end-to-end
- Validate the cost ratio data model
- Provide a stable reference implementation before Shopify integration

No build tools, no frameworks, no backend.

## What this is

A single-page, client-side calculator that:
1. Uses a U.S. monthly spending profile as a baseline
2. Applies conservative, national-average cost ratios by country
3. Produces a comparative monthly cost estimate

This is intended for **relocation planning**, not city-level budgeting.
